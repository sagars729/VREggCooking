# Eggceeding Eggspectations: Virtual Reality Cooking Simulation

Check out our [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SN7jgW1QCI_E631C5BG9lrlz2qb1QOPVZpJ3Eh7OvV4/edit?usp=sharing) and our [Paper](https://github.com/sagars729/VREggCooking/blob/main/CMSC838C_Final_Project.pdf)!

Current Virtual Reality cooking applications and games abstract the true experience of cooking into simple objects, leading to a user experience that doesn't truly mirror that of an actual cooking scenario. Real cooking involves complex visual, audio, and haptic feedback that isn't emulated in virtual environments; creating more precise and realistic interactions can help improve the VR cooking experience. In this paper, we explore techniques to simulate realistic cooking, specifically exploring the process of cooking an egg from start to finish.
